# GPGME (golang)

Go wrapper for the GPGME library.

This library is intended for use with desktop applications. If you are looking to add OpenPGP support to a server application I suggest you first look at [golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp).

## Installation

    go get -u github.com/proglottis/gpgme
