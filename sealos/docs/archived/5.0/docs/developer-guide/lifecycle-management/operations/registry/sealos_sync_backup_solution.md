# Efficient Sealos Cluster Image Synchronization and Backup Strategy

In our daily work, we may encounter some common needs and issues, such as:

1. Needing to regularly backup the image repository in the cluster, but not wanting to synchronize everything.
2. Needing to use an external image repository, but the container images in the Sealos cluster image are not yet
   available.
3. Container images are large, and there is a desire to avoid transferring image files during Sealos operation to reduce
   bandwidth usage.

To solve the above problems, Sealos provides an elegant solution. Below, I will guide you step by step to understand
this solution.

## Creating and Starting a Temporary Repository

First, we need the registry directory in the cluster image for image synchronization. Therefore, execute the following
command to pull the cluster image and create a working directory:

```shell
sealos pull labring/kubernetes:v1.24.0 
sealos create labring/kubernetes:v1.24.0
```

Then, we start a temporary registry in the registry directory of the working directory. For convenience, we can fix a
port, such as 9090. Then, execute the following command:

```shell
sealos registry serve filesystem -p 9090 registry
```

Note that this is a resident process. Please ensure the service is available before synchronization is complete.

## Image Synchronization

Next, we synchronize the local cluster image to sealos.hub:5000 (or other repositories) in the cluster. Before executing
the synchronization command, if the repository needs authentication, please first use sealos login to login. Then,
execute the following command:

```shell
sealos registry sync 127.0.0.1:9090 sealos.hub:5000
```

## Results Display

After executing the above steps, you will see an output similar to the following:

As you can see, existing images will not be synchronized again, this can achieve incremental image synchronization,
making the entire process very elegant and efficient.
