In this directory, we provide a variety of different methods and techniques to help you effectively build Sealos cluster images. Here is a brief overview of the directory files:

1. **Basic Building**: This section contains all the basic information on how to start building a Sealos cluster image from scratch. This includes installing Sealos, creating and configuring the environment, as well as the steps to run the build command.

2. **Advanced Building**: If you already have some understanding of Sealos, this section provides more complex and challenging building methods, such as using multi-stage builds to reduce image size, or using the advanced options of the `sealos build` command for custom building.
