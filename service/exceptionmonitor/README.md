# RESTServer

## Description

restserver for database monitoring

## Getting Started

### Running on the cluster

1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/sealos-cloud-database-monitor:tag
```

2. Deploy the restserver:

```sh
kubectl apply -f deploy/manifests/
```
  
### How it works

To enable the database frontend application to retrieve monitoring data, you need to modify the environment variable `MONITOR_URL` of the frontend deployment to the corresponding address of the restserver.

Additionally, to configure the data source, you need to set the environment variable `VM_SERVICE_HOST` of the restserver deployment to the correct address.

```
e.g.
http://prometheus.sealos.svc.cluster.local
```
