# Issues translator workflow - temporarily disabled
# 
# This workflow is temporarily disabled because it requires an external bot
# to join the repository with proper permissions to function correctly.
# The current setup using GITHUB_TOKEN has insufficient permissions.
#
# To re-enable this workflow:
# 1. Set up a bot account or obtain a personal access token with proper permissions
# 2. Add the token as a repository secret (e.g., BOT_GITHUB_TOKEN)
# 3. Update the workflow to use the new token
# 4. Remove the "if: false" condition below
