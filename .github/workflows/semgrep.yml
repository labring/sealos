  # Determine when you want Semgrep to scan your code.
  # Use as many of the following options as you want.
  # (Currently Options 1 and 3 are active).
  #
  # Option 1: Scan changed files in PRs, only report new findings (existing
  # findings in the repository are ignored).
  # To run on specific types of PR states (opened, reopened, etc) or particular
  # paths or branches, see the following GitHub documentation:
  # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request
  pull_request: {}

  # Option 2: Scan all files on branches, report any findings.
  # push:
  #   branches: ["master", "main"]

  # Option 3: Schedule CI job to run at a certain time, using cron syntax.
  # Note: the asterisk sign * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 0 1,15 * *' # scheduled for 00:30 UTC on both the 1st and 15th of the month
