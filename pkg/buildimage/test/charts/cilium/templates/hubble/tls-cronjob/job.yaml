Because Kubernetes job specs are immutable, Helm will fail patch this job if
the spec changes between releases. To avoid breaking the upgrade path, we
generate a name for the job here which is based on the checksum of the spec.
This will cause the name of the job to change if its content changes,
and in turn cause Helm to do delete the old job and replace it with a new one.
