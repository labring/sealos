# What is Sealos?

<Highlight content="Try Sealos now" url="https://cloud.sealos.io" />

The vastness and complexity of the cloud-native ecosystem undoubtedly leaves many businesses in disarray, yearning for
an efficient, ready-to-use distribution, which this ecosystem sorely lacks. The cloud-native market is in dire need of a
cloud operating system to further reduce barriers and costs.

The advent of Sealos opens a new window for enterprises. It provides a novel choice for businesses and developers alike,
necessitating only the installation of a cloud operating system, regardless of public or private cloud use. It allows
various applications to operate stably and securely, tackling all sorts of dependency issues they might require.

Sealos adheres to the philosophy that **cloud usage can be as simple as Linux**. You can commence usage right after
installation, as you would with Linux, without entanglement in excessive complexities. The sole difference is that while
Linux is installed on a single server, Sealos is installed across an entire data center.

In Sealos's architecture, **there's no essential difference between public and private clouds**. They should be separate
instances of the same codebase, the only distinction lying in their configuration and installed applications. Installing
it on an intranet renders it a private cloud, while offering services on the public internet converts it into a public
cloud.

We firmly believe that with the continuous development and advancement of Sealos, the future of cloud computing will be
more open, more straightforward. The benefits of cloud computing should belong to all providers of computational power,
and the value of the cloud should be shared by all participants of cloud computing. **They will be able to enjoy the
various conveniences of cloud computing in a more economical fashion in a diversified market environment.**

## Overview

Sealos is a **cloud operating system distribution** based on the Kubernetes kernel. It adopts a cloud-native approach,
discarding traditional cloud computing architecture, and shifting towards a new architecture with Kubernetes as the
cloud kernel. This allows enterprises to use the cloud **as effortlessly as they would use a personal computer**.

Users will be able to install any high-availability distributed application on Kubernetes with the click of a button,
similar to using a personal computer. It practically requires no professional delivery or operational costs.
Simultaneously, utilizing unique cluster imaging capabilities, users can package any distributed application into an OCI
image, freely combine a variety of distributed applications, and easily customize their desired cloud. The powerful and
flexible app store function can meet the diverse needs of various users.
