# Swiftly Install MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB with Database

Databases are important means of data management and can be used to efficiently store and access data. MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB are all important database management systems.

* MySQL is an open-source relational database management system with high performance, reliability, and scalability. It also supports standardized SQL language and extended SQL syntax

* PostgreSQL is also an open-source relational database management system that supports transaction, concurrency control, and multi-version control. These features make PostgreSQL a reliable, efficient, and secure database solution

* MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database management system that supports flexible data modeling, fast read and write speeds, and easy horizontal scaling for better performance and availability, as per the requirements
