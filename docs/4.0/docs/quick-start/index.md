[cloud terminal](https://www.sealos.io/docs/cloud/apps/terminal/) It is the recommended tool to operate sealos cloud through CLI.
You can also debug other pod svc, etc, utilizing the terminal.

If you need a separate database instanceï¼Œ[sealos pgsql](https://www.sealos.io/docs/cloud/apps/postgres/) is a good choice, you can create a pgsql database in minutes.
