## What is sealos

**sealos is a cloud operating system distribution with Kubernetes as its kernel.**

In the early stages, operatings systems have adopted a layered architecture, which later evolved into kernel architecture like Linux and Windows. With the emergence of container technologies, cloud OS will migrate to a "cloud kernel" architecture with strong cohesion in the future.

- From now on, think of all your machines as an abstract supercomputer whose operating system is sealos, where Kubernetes serves as the OS kernel.
- Instead of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, there will only be cloud OS drivers(CSI, CNI and CRI implementations), cloud OS kernel(Kubernetes) and distributed applications.

> Core Capabilities

- Cluster image 
  - [x] The entire cluster will be able to build, ship and run. 
  - [x] Semantics of docker will be extended to clusters so that any distributed applications can be defined and run smoothly.
- hub.sealos 
  - [x] A cluster image repository where you can retrieve pre-built distributed applications such as basic Kubernetes cluster image, high availability pgsql cluster image, high availability minio cluster image, etc.
- desktop.sealos 
  - [ ] A desktop for cloud OS, not to be confused with traditional cloud desktop. It is similar to macOS, but manages cluster and distributed applications instead of personal computers.
- Distributed application matrix 
  - [x] Anything you need including storage / network / HA database / message queue / monitoring can be retrieved with a click of the mouse, or simply `sealos run`.
  - [x] sealos now support 20+ HA applications.

## Core features

- Manage clusters lifecycle 
  - [x] Quickly install HA Kubernetes clusters
  - [x] Add / remove nodes
  - [x] Clean the cluster, backup and auto recovering, etc.
- Download and use OCI-compatible distributed applications
  - [x] Openebs, minio, ingress, pgsql, mysql, redis, etc.
- Customize you own distributed applications
  - [x] Using Dockerfile to build distributed applications images, save all dependencies.
  - [x] Push distributed applications images to docker hub.
  - [x] Combine many applications to build your own cloud platform.

## Quickstart

> Installing an HA kubernetes cluster with calico as CNI

Here `kubernetes:v1.24.0` and `calico:v3.22.1` are the cluster images in the registry which are fully compatible with OCI standard. Wonder if we can use flannel instead? Of course!

```shell script
# Download and install sealos. sealos is a golang binary so you can just download and copy to bin. You may also download it from release page.
$ wget -c https://sealyun-home.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/sealos-4.0/latest/sealos-amd64 -O sealos && \
    chmod +x sealos && mv sealos /usr/bin
# Create a cluster
$ sealos run labring/kubernetes:v1.24.0 labring/calico:v3.22.1 \
     --masters 192.168.64.2,192.168.64.22,192.168.64.20 \
     --nodes 192.168.64.21,192.168.64.19 -p [your-ssh-passwd]
```

> Building a custom cluster image

See [Building an ingress cluster image](https://github.com/labring/sealos/blob/main/docs/4.0/build-example-ingress-helm.md).

> Storage, message queue, database, etc.

Don't be shocked by the following:

```shell script
$ sealos run labring/helm:v3.8.2 # install helm
$ sealos run labring/openebs:v1.9.0 # install openebs
$ sealos run labring/minio-operator:v4.4.16 labring/ingress-nginx:4.1.0 \
   labring/mysql-operator:8.0.23-14.1 labring/redis-operator:3.1.4 # oneliner
```

And now everything is ready.
