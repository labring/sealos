We are excited to announce the official release of Sealos v4.2.1-rc5 ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰!

## Sealos : A Cloud Operating System designed for managing cloud-native applications

Sealos is a cloud operating system distribution based on the Kubernetes kernel. It adopts a cloud-native approach, discarding traditional cloud computing architecture, and shifting towards a new architecture with Kubernetes as the cloud kernel. This allows enterprises to use the cloud as effortlessly as they would use a personal computer.
