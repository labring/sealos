                  expirationSeconds is the requested duration of validity of the issued
                  certificate. The certificate signer may issue a certificate with a different
                  validity duration so a client must check the delta between the notBefore and
                  notAfter fields in the issued certificate to determine the actual duration.


                  The minimum valid value for expirationSeconds is 600, i.e. 10 minutes.
