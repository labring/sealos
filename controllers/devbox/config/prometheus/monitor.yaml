        # TODO(user): The option insecureSkipVerify: true is not recommended for production since it disables
        # certificate verification. This poses a significant security risk by making the system vulnerable to
        # man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker could intercept and manipulate the communication between
        # Prometheus and the monitored services. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive metrics data,
        # compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the information.
        # Please use the following options for secure configurations:
        # caFile: /etc/metrics-certs/ca.crt
        # certFile: /etc/metrics-certs/tls.crt
        # keyFile: /etc/metrics-certs/tls.key
