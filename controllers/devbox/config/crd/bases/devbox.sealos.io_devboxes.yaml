                            All ports within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When considering

                          description: |-
                            ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                            The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                            and deleted when the pod is removed.


                            Use this if:
                            a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                            b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                               tracking are needed,
                            c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                            d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                               a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                               information on the connection between this volume type
                               and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                            Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                            APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                            of an individual pod.


                            Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                            be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                            more information.


                            A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                            persistent volumes at the same time.

                                Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                manually reconstructing a broken cluster.


                                This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
                                to the PVC after it has been created.

                                        dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                        volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                        core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                        When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                        the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                        provisioner.
                                        This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                        if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            hostPath represents a pre-existing file or directory on the host
                            machine that is directly exposed to the container. This is generally
                            used for system agents or other privileged things that are allowed
                            to see the host machine. Most containers will NOT need this.

                        Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                        When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                        Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                        If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                    operator:
                      description: |-
                        Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                        Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
