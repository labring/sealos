# controller

Infra controller, apply any infra resource your want.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/controller:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/controller:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

# Create infra

infra.yaml: 

```yaml
apiVersion: infra.sealos.io/v1
kind: Infra
metadata:
  name: infra-apply-test
spec:
  hosts:
  - roles: [master] # required
    count: 3 # Required
    flavor: "t2.micro"
    image: "ami-05248307900d52e3a"
  - roles: [ node ] # required
    count: 3 # Required
    flavor: "t2.micro"
    image: "ami-05248307900d52e3a"
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f infra.yaml
```

Scale down:

```yaml
apiVersion: infra.sealos.io/v1
kind: Infra
metadata:
  name: infra-apply-test
spec:
  hosts:
  - roles: [master] # required
    count: 1 # Required
    flavor: "t2.micro"
    image: "ami-05248307900d52e3a"
  - roles: [ node ] # required
    count: 1 # Required
    flavor: "t2.micro"
    image: "ami-05248307900d52e3a"
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f infra.yaml
```

Scale up:

```yaml
apiVersion: infra.sealos.io/v1
kind: Infra
metadata:
  name: infra-apply-test
spec:
  hosts:
    - roles: [ master ]
      count: 1
      flavor: t2.medium
      image: "ami-0d66b970b9f16f1f5"
      disks:
        - capacity: 23
          volumeType: standard
          type: "root"
        - capacity: 21
          volumeType: gp3
          type: "data"
    - roles: [ node ]
      count: 1
      flavor: t2.medium
      image: "ami-0d66b970b9f16f1f5"
      disks:
        - capacity: 11
          volumeType: gp3
          type: "root"
        - capacity: 13
          volumeType: gp3
          type: "data"
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f infra.yaml
```

Clean infra:

```shell
kubectl delete -f infra.yaml
```
