## Sealos Components: Docker Containers and Binary Files

Sealos provides two Docker containers: sealos and lvscare, as well as two binary files: sealctl and image-cri-shim. Below is a brief introduction of these components:

- sealos container: This container is the core component of the Sealos project, responsible for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters and distributed applications.
  It provides a series of command-line tools, allowing users to quickly build and maintain clusters.
  ```
  docker pull ghcr.io/{{ .Env.USERNAME }}/{{ .ProjectName }}:{{ .Tag }}
  ```
- lvscare container: This container is responsible for managing load balancing within Kubernetes clusters.
  It can monitor node status in real-time, ensuring that the load balancer always routes traffic to available nodes.
  ```
  docker pull ghcr.io/{{ .Env.USERNAME }}/lvscare:{{ .Tag }}
  ```
- sealctl binary file: This is a command-line tool provided by the Sealos project, designed to simplify cluster management tasks, such as certificate management, IPVS, hosts, and cluster certificates.
- image-cri-shim binary file: This component is a CRI adapter for the Sealos project, supporting different container runtimes (such as Docker and containerd).
  It allows Sealos to seamlessly integrate with multiple runtimes, improving the project's flexibility and scalability.
