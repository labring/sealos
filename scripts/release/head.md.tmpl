### Component Introduction

Sealos provides two Docker containers: sealos and lvscare, as well as two binary files: sealctl and image-cri-shim. Below is a brief introduction to these components:

- Sealos Container: This container is the core component of the Sealos project, responsible for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters and distributed applications. It offers a range of command-line tools to help users quickly build and maintain clusters.
- lvscare Container: This container is used to support load balancing management within Kubernetes clusters. It can monitor node status in real-time, ensuring that the load balancer always routes traffic to available nodes.
- sealctl Binary: This is a command-line tool provided by the Sealos project, used to simplify cluster management tasks such as certificate management, IPVS, hosts, and cluster certificates.
- image-cri-shim Binary: This component is a CRI adapter for the Sealos project, supporting different container runtimes (such as Docker and containerd). It allows Sealos to seamlessly integrate with multiple runtimes, enhancing the project's flexibility and scalability.

### Quick Start

```shell
# Create a cluster
sealos run labring/kubernetes:v1.25.0 labring/helm:v3.8.2 labring/calico:v3.24.1 \
