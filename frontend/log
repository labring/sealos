✔ Introspected 58 models and wrote them into prisma/global/schema.prisma in 1.86s
      
*** WARNING ***

These fields were enriched with `@map` information taken from the previous Prisma schema:
  - Model: "UserInfo", field: "userUid"
  - Model: "UserInfo", field: "signUpRegionUid"
  - Model: "UserInfo", field: "isInited"
  - Model: "WorkspaceUsage", field: "userUid"
  - Model: "WorkspaceUsage", field: "workspaceUid"
  - Model: "WorkspaceUsage", field: "regionUid"
  - Model: "WorkspaceUsage", field: "createdAt"
  - Model: "WorkspaceUsage", field: "updatedAt"

The following models were ignored as they do not have a valid unique identifier or id. This is currently not supported by Prisma Client:
  - "Configs"

  - "UserRealNameInfo"
  - "UserSemChannel"
