# lens

This project is the web version of [Lens](https://github.com/lensapp/lens), but it's still on development and only implemented 'list' operation of a few KubeObjects, which are **Pod, Deployment, Stateful Set, ConfigMap, Persistent Volume Claim**.  
We use some Lens' source code and its similar layout and a few components to build this project.
