# image-cri-shim configuration with registry priority examples
#
# This configuration demonstrates how to set up registry priorities
# to control the order in which registries are tried when pulling images.

shim: /var/run/image-cri-shim.sock
cri: /var/run/containerd/containerd.sock
address: http://sealos.hub:5000
auth: admin:passw0rd
version: v1
timeout: 15m
debug: false

# Optional: Customize sealos.hub priority
# Default: 1000 (highest)
# Set to 0 or omit this field to use default
# Lower this value if you want other registries to be tried first
offlinePriority: 1000

# Cache configuration
cache:
  imageCacheSize: 1024
  imageCacheTTL: 30m
  domainCacheTTL: 10m
  statsLogInterval: 1m
  disableStats: false

# Registry configuration with priorities
registries:
  # Example 1: Docker Hub with default priority (500)
  # When priority is not specified, defaults to 500
  - address: docker.io
    auth: dockeruser:dockerpass

  # Example 2: Private registry with higher priority (800)
  # This registry will be tried before docker.io but after sealos.hub
  - address: registry.example.com
    auth: reguser:regpass
    priority: 800

  # Example 3: Slow registry with low priority (100)
  # This registry will be tried last
  - address: slow-registry.company.com
    auth: slowuser:slowpass
    priority: 100

  # Example 4: Another registry with medium priority (600)
  - address: gcr.io
    auth: gcruser:gcrpass
    priority: 600

  # Example 5: Registry with priority exceeding maximum (clamped to 1000)
  # This will have the same priority as sealos.hub, but sealos.hub comes first in tie-breaking
  - address: another-registry.io
    auth: anotheruser:anotherpass
    priority: 2000  # Will be clamped to 1000

  # Example 6: Registry with negative priority (clamped to 0)
  # This registry will be tried last (lowest priority)
  - address: backup-registry.io
    auth: backupuser:backuppass
    priority: -50  # Will be clamped to 0

# Priority Order (highest to lowest):
# 1. sealos.hub (priority 1000, set via offlinePriority)
# 2. another-registry.io (priority 1000, clamped from 2000)
# 3. registry.example.com (priority 800)
# 4. gcr.io (priority 600)
# 5. docker.io (priority 500, default)
# 6. slow-registry.company.com (priority 100)
# 7. backup-registry.io (priority 0, clamped from -50)
#
# When pulling an image, image-cri-shim will:
# - First check sealos.hub for the image
# - If not found, check another-registry.io
# - Continue down the list until a registry has the image
# - Use the original image name if no registry has it
#
# The result is cached, so subsequent pulls use the cached registry (within TTL)

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example: Lowering sealos.hub priority
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# If you have a faster registry and want it to be tried before sealos.hub:
#
# address: http://sealos.hub:5000
# auth: admin:passw0rd
# offlinePriority: 700  # Lower than default (1000)
#
# registries:
#   - address: fast-registry.io
#     auth: fastuser:fastpass
#     priority: 900  # Higher than sealos.hub, will be tried first
#
#   - address: docker.io
#     auth: dockeruser:dockerpass
#     # priority: 500 (default)
#
# Priority Order in this case:
# 1. fast-registry.io (priority 900)
# 2. sealos.hub (priority 700)
# 3. docker.io (priority 500)
